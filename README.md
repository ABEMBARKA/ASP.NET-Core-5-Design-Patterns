# Introduction

This repository contains the code of `An atypical .NET 5 Design Patterns book`.
It also contains pointers to help you find yourself around the repository and some additional information.

One last thing this repo will do for you is to correct any mistake that could have been made in the book.
So please an open issue if you find something missing from the instruction bellow or the book's instructions.

# Postman Collection

If you know Postman, or if you want to learn it, we created a collection of HTTP requests to query the various REST APIs that are created throughout the book.

Link: https://net5.link/postman

The structure is as follow:

![Postman Collection](.assets/postman-collection.png)

The author built that collection to test the code himself while writing the book.
Since he needed it, we concluded that you could also find these requests useful during your journey.

If you think a request is missing or find an error, please open an issue to let us know.

# UML Diagrams

In the book, we have UML Class diagrams, UML Sequence Diagrams, and some non-UML diagrams.
We assumed that most-developers would know about that, so did not write about it.
The book also contains many pages, so there was no need to add more.

The author used [diagrams.net (draw.io)](https://draw.io/) to draw the diagrams (which is free and open-source).
You can even load their editor in Visual Studio Code using the [Draw.io Integration](https://net5.link/w32e) extension.

# Getting Started

1. You need a copy of `An atypical .NET 5 Design Patterns book` to make sense of the code projects as many projects starts with bad code and get refactored into better ones.

    - <mark>TODO: add a link</mark>

1. You need an IDE/Text Editor like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, but you could do without (not recommended).

    - [Download Visual Studio](https://net5.link/VS)
    - [Download Visual Studio Code](https://net5.link/VSC)

1. You need .NET 5 SDK. If you installed Visual Studio, you should be fine. Otherwise, here is the link:

    - [Download .NET 5](https://net5.link/SDK)

With that in place, you should be good to go!

# Build and Test

All projects and solutions can be built using the .NET CLI or Visual Studio.
You can find most useful commands in the introduction chapter, under `Running and building your program` or online.

The two commands that you will need are:

-   `dotnet build` to build a project or solution
-   `dotnet test` to run a test project or all tests of all test projects of a solution.

# Content/Code

There are many projects throughout the book, and it may become confusing to know what code block relates to what file in the Git repository.
Here we map the location of the code to its location in the book.
If at any point you are not totally sure, please have a look here.

1. <mark>TODO: map chapters and projects to code</mark>

If you find something missing or erroneous, please open an issue and let us know.

# Contribute

Please open an issue if you find some missing docs, errors in the source code, or divergence between the book and the source code.
